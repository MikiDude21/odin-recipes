            Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, 
            cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
             A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. 
                Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; 
                cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. 
                Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over 
                pizza</li>

            <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
